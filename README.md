# Quantitative analysis for a FinTech investing platform
### Task 
Evaluate four new investment options for inclusion in the client portfolios. Legendary fund and hedge-fund managers run all four selections. (People sometimes refer to these managers as whales because of the large amount of money that they manage). Youâ€™ll need to determine the fund with the most investment potential based on key risk-management metrics: the daily returns, standard deviations, Sharpe ratios, and betas.
